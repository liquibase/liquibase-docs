        <h1>How To: Choose Between CONVERT (ddl) and DDL_DIRECT (ddl_direct) Packaging Methods</h1>
        <h2 id="HowTo:ChooseBetweenCONVERT(ddl)andDDL_DIRECT(ddl_direct)PackagingMethods-TheDifferenceBetweenCONVERT(ddl)andDDL_DIRECT(ddl_direct)Packaging">The Difference Between CONVERT (ddl) and DDL_DIRECT (ddl_direct) Packaging</h2>
        <p>The CONVERT and DDL_DIRECT package methods work very differently. The CONVERT packaging method does not run the actual sql script during deploy. Instead, it creates an XML change set by comparing a “before” snapshot to the “after” snapshot and generating the change set based upon the difference between the two snapshots. In contrast, the DDL_DIRECT packaging method runs the actual script using the native database command line tools.  </p>
        <p>For additional information regarding the CONVERT and DDL_DIRECT (or DIRECT) packaging methods, see the following pages:</p>

        <p>Since the CONVERT and DDL_DIRECT packaging methods operate differently, one method may be preferred over the other depending upon the situation. </p>
        <p>Note that DDL_DIRECT is only available with versions 7.15 and later.</p>

        <p><strong>Pros</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The CONVERT packaging method provides the full forecasting and rules validation capabilities available with Datical.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The change sets are very granular allowing failed deploys to be re-executed from the point of failure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cons</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The CONVERT packaging method takes longer because of the extra work required to generate the snapshots and perform the comparison.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The order of statements within a SQL script may not be preserved when they are converted to XML change sets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>SQL statements that will not generate a change set by diffing the before and after states of the database will not be deployed.</p>
            </li>

        <p><strong>Pros</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The DDL_DIRECT packaging method is faster because it does not have to generate and compare database snapshots.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The order of SQL statements within a script is maintained.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The SQL script timeout setting can be used to terminate run-away or hung scripts.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cons</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Scripts packaged using DDL_DIRECT are not forecasted, unless using SQL Parser for Oracle. </p>

                    <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Package DDL using CONVERT to get the most comprehensive forecasting and rules validation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Package DDL using DDL_DIRECT when packaging is taking too long due to snapshot generation.  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Performance may be significantly improved for managed schemas that contain thousands of objects.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use SQL Parser for Oracle when packaging using DDL_DIRECT to provide forecasting for supported object types. Remember that not all objects can be forecasted by SQL Parser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Package complex scripts where the order of SQL execution must be maintained using DDL_DIRECT.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make scripts packaged using DDL_DIRECT as granular as possible. Consider using naming convention or commit order to maintain the sequence of SQL statements instead of packaging them in a single script.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>More granular scripts will allow you to recover from a failed deploy much easier. Scripts are considered a single change set. If the script fails mid-way, Datical will try to re-execute the entire script. If non-rerunnable changes were made, a second execution of the script will fail. Manual database cleanup will be required in order to complete the deploy.</p>
