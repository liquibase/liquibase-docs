        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /> 4.26.0 and later, you can use the <code class="language-text">--snapshot-filters</code> parameter to limit the types of database objects you include in your snapshot. If your database is very large, including only the objects relevant to you in the snapshot can improve the command's performance.</p>
