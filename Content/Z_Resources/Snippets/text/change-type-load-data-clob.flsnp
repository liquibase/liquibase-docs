        <h3><code>CLOB</code> data type handling</h3>
        <p>In Liquibase 4.29.2 and earlier, all CSV entries in a <code>clob</code> type column are assumed to be a path to a file. If Liquibase finds that file, it inserts the contents of the file into the table you're updating. If not, the execution stops with an error:</p><pre><code>Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: The file ExampleFileName was not found in the configured search path:</code></pre>
        <p>In Liquibase 4.30.0 and later, all CSV entries in a <code>clob</code> type column are assumed to be a path to a file by default. If Liquibase finds that file, it inserts the contents of the file into the table you're updating. If not, Liquibase inserts the string value as-is.</p>
