        <p>Liquibase uses the DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK table ensure only one instance of Liquibase is running at one time.</p>
        <p>Because Liquibase simply reads from the <a href="databasechangelog-table.html">DATABASECHANGELOG</a> table to determine which changeSets need to run, if multiple instances of Liquibase are executed against the same database concurrently you will get conflicts.
This can happen if multiple developers use the same database instance or if there are multiple servers in a cluster which auto-run Liquibase on startup.</p>

        <p>If Liquibase does not exit cleanly, the lock row may be left as locked. You can clear out the current lock by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">liquibase releaseLocks</code> which runs <code class="highlighter-rouge">UPDATE DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK SET LOCKED=0</code></p>
