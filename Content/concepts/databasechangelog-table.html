        <p>Liquibase uses the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DATABASECHANGELOG</code> table to track which changeSets have been run.</p>
        <p>The table tracks each changeSet as a row, identified by a combination of the “id”, “author”, and “filename” columns.</p>
        <p>There is no primary key on the table. This is to avoid any database-specific restrictions on key lengths. The composite of “id”, “author”, and “filename” 
is unique across all rows of the table.</p>
