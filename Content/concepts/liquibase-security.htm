        <h1>Liquibase Security</h1>
        <h2>Keeping your data secure</h2>
        <p>Liquibase maintains administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your  personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, loss, and misuse.</p>
        <p>No online transmission is ever guaranteed to be fully secure or error-free, including email. Liquibase recommends not sending or disclosing any sensitive personal information to us directly or through our products.</p>
        <p class="example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;">protected health information, passwords, and authentication/authorization credentials for other services.</p>
        <p>
            Liquibase collects <MadCap:xref href="../analytics/home.html">Anonymous Analytics</MadCap:xref> about command use for development purposes, but does not share this data externally. For more detailed information on how Liquibase collects and uses your personal information, read the <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or use of your personal information, you can <a href="https://www.liquibase.com/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
        <h2>Enhancing your database security</h2>
        <p>Liquibase lets you validate all database changes and use automation to control database access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you store credentials for your application CD solution in a central, secure location such as <a href="../liquibase-pro/secrets-management/hashicorp-vault.htm">HashiCorp Vault</a>, automation can gather credentials from the tool and pass them to  Liquibase without direct human access. Using this best practice with Liquibase decreases the surface area for database attacks.
            </li>
            <li>If you have a large number of users who make manual schema changes to the database, Liquibase eliminates the need for them to have direct database access.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Storing your credentials</h2>
        <p>Liquibase recommends storing user credentials in a secure credential repository, entering them in the CLI at runtime, or using <MadCap:xref href="connections/liquibase-environment-variables.htm">[%=General.Liquibase%] Environment Variables</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Using Liquibase and source control</h2>
        <p>Source control systems will help you manage and track the history of your resources, including changelogs and changesets. Using source control, you have an option to view when a file was changed, compare the changes that were made, and know who made the changes. Liquibase works with any source control system.</p>
        <p>Liquibase versions your database changes, so storing these changes in a Source Control Management system is a best practice. Liquibase recommends you follow these best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep changelogs in the same repository as application code to ensure everything is kept in sync.</li>
            <li>Keep changesets in separate files to save time on searches and updates or avoid potential merge conflicts.</li>
            <li>Keep changelogs organized to identify your files by releases, database object types, or other information you prefer.</li>
            <li>Use branch and file naming standards to maintain logical patterns so you can see the exact changes in your branches and files.</li>
        </ul>
