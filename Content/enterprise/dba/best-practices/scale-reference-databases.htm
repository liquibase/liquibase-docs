        <h1>Best Practices for Scaling Reference Databases</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p>This document provides you with ideas on how to manage a growing number of reference databases as teams adopt <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" />.</p>
        <h2 id="BestPracticesforScalingReferenceDatabases-Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>During early phase of <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> adoption, teams typically setup Reference Databases on their own, so they may not be using centralized infrastructure from day 1. This allows teams flexibility to manage and configure their Reference Databases as well as underlying servers. However, as <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> usage grows, the approach above would create a sprawl of Reference Databases. To better manage sprawl, it would be ideal to move Reference Databases to centralized/shared infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Note that Reference Databases are typically structure-only databases without any significant amount of data. You may still need lookup data or test data to validate objects.</p>
        <h2 id="BestPracticesforScalingReferenceDatabases-ReferenceDatabasesforSQLServer">Reference Databases for SQL Server</h2>
        <p>You could put a large number of Reference Databases on single SQL Server instance. The number of Reference Database per instance would be dictated by the size of each Reference Database (size depends on number of objects in the database and the amount of data needed in the database).</p>
        <p>Database name collisions could occur when different teams use the same database name. In that case, a separate database instance would be needed.</p>
        <p>If dealing with multiple versions of SQL Server (2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, etc.). You could setup different versions of SQL Server on the same server. Each version of SQL Server would run as a separate Database Engine instance.</p>
        <p>The best practice, however, for scaling out SQL Server-based Reference Databases would be to arrange separate servers for each version of SQL Server. And then run only one version of Database Engine (SQL Server instance) per server. It would be possible to set up multiple servers for the same version of Database Engine to support the case for database name collisions.</p>
        <h2 id="BestPracticesforScalingReferenceDatabases-ReferenceDatabaseforOracle11g">Reference Database for Oracle 11g</h2>
        <p>An Oracle Reference Database is essentially one or more schemas in an Oracle instance.</p>
        <p>In a pipeline that consists of DEV, QA, UAT and PROD environments, the schema name (e.g., "appSchema") would be consistent across each environment. As such, there would be multiple Oracle instances configured for each environment and each instance would have "appSchema" defined.</p>
        <p>Because schema names have to be unique within an Oracle instance, this creates the need to setup new Oracle instances for each <u>numbered</u> Reference Databases.</p>
        <p>Each <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> project could have one or more pipelines. This allows application teams to have multiple concurrent release streams. <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> requires that each pipelines has a dedicated Reference Database in the following manner. The table below shows sample pipelines for one <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> project</p>

        <p>The best practice, for scaling out Oracle 11g based Reference Databases would be to setup one Oracle 11g instance per server and have separate servers for each Oracle 11g instance. In the example above, you would setup 5 servers, each with a single Oracle 11g instance. The number of Reference Database per Oracle 11g instance would be dictated by the size of each Reference Database (size depends on number of objects in the database and the amount of data needed in the database).</p>
        <h2 id="BestPracticesforScalingReferenceDatabases-ReferenceDatabasesforOracle12c">Reference Databases for Oracle 12c</h2>
        <p>Oracle 12c has the concept of pluggable databases (PDBs). APDB&#160;is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and non-schema objects that appear to an Oracle&#160;Net client as a separate database. One or more PDBs together are called a containerdatabase(CDB).</p>
        <p>Because each PDB is a separate database, you can configure all Reference Databases as PDBs on a single Oracle 12c container. The number of PDBs (hence number Reference Databases) per Oracle 12 container would be dictated by the size of each Reference Database (size depends on number of objects in the database and the amount of data needed in the database). Creating a PDB is very similar to creating a database instance in 11g from a resource standpoint (i.e., memory, storage, processes – although some are shared at the container level). Managing large number of Reference PDBs presents the same challenges as sprawl proliferation mentioned in the Introduction section above, except they would be more concentrated with the container concept.</p>
        <p>With that said, the shared REF environments model described in the Oracle 11g section could be applied to Oracle 12c PDBs. Numbered Reference Databases would be PDBs in Oracle 12c containers. To address situations where two projects have the same schema name you would need additional PDBs, without requiring additional Oracle 12c containers.</p>

        <p><strong>Best Practices for High Availability</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Because possibly large number of databases will be running on few servers, it would be necessary to consider High Availability options for each database. Reference Databases are critical components of <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> and if these databases go offline you are unable to package database changes until those database are back online.</p>
        <p>The key consideration here is for SQL Server instances. The out-of-the-box configuration for SQL Server requires elevated privileges which requires SQL Server instances to be configured in single user mode. However, a custom, non-elevated setup can be used which can work with SQL Server instances configured in Availability Groups (AG).</p>
