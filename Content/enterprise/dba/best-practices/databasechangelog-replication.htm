        <h1>Troubleshoot <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> Replication Error</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <h2>Issue:</h2>
        <p>When Liquibase Enterprise is in an environment with active database replication,  you may run into issues that relate to the <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> tracking table, which actively tracks changes in Liquibase. Typically this is first noticed when performing a Rollback operation as this operation will delete records from the DATABASECHANGELOG table.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Below is a  PostgreSQL specific example of an error that can appear. This can occur in other database settings so the resolution will be the same.</p>
        <h2>Error: </h2><pre xml:space="preserve" style="white-space: pre-line">cannot delete from table <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> because it does not have a replica identity and publishes deletes 2HINT: To enable deleting from the table, set REPLICA IDENTITY using ALTER TABLE. 3SQL state: 55000</pre>
        <h2>Solution:</h2>
        <p>Many database replication tools require all replicated tables to have a primary key or unique constraint.  This enables the replication tool to efficiently replicate data changes to those tables. <br /><br />If running into an error similar to one above, try the below resolution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manually create a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE CONSTRAINT on the <MadCap:variable name="General.databasechangelog" /> table using columns: ID, AUTHOR, FILENAME</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">This is a solution in 8.1 and later.  This occurred initially in a Postgres database but can occur in other settings so this can apply to all users.</p>
