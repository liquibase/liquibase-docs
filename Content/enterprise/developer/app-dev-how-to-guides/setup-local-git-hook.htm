        <p>The above code can be used for the client side Git hook. This script with ensure that the git commit message has a JIRA ticket listed If the JIRA ticket is missing from the commit, then the commit will fail.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The script needs to go in the *_sql repo in the .git/hooks/ directory.</li>
            <li>The script needs to have execute permission</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Maintaining hooks for a team of DBAs can be a little tricky because the .git/hooks directory isn't cloned with the rest of your project, nor is it under version control. A simple solution to both of these problems is to store your hooks in the actual project directory (above the .git directory). This lets you edit them like any other version-controlled file.</p>
        <p>To install the hook, you can either create a symlink to it in .git/hooks (non Windows platforms) , or you can copy and paste it into the .git/hooks directory whenever the hook is updated.</p>
