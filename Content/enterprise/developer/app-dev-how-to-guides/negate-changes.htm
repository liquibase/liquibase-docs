        <h1>How To: Negate changes

        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/images/.ver_icon_size_enterprise.flsnp" />
        <p>This document describes the case of negating database changes that have been packaged and deployed into the <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> pipeline but deemed unnecessary to be deployed all the way into the PROD environment.</p>
        <p>The idea is that these changes could be deployed into PROD safely as long as there is also a script which negates those changes.</p>
        <p>Examples of such cases are: Adding a new object, e.g., a new table, a new column or a new procedure, and this object is no longer needed. Since the addition of an object is not a concern for data loss, it is safe to deploy such changes into the pipeline. These changes could be safely negated by another script. As a result, the final state of the database would not show any of those changes.</p>
        <p>There is a separate use case around changes that are deemed detrimental and therefore cannot be deployed into higher environments. For example, doing so could result in a data loss. This use case is captured in another guide "<a href="negate-changes.htm">How To: Abandon changes</a>" which will prevent changes from deploying further in the pipeline.</p>
        <h2 id="HowTo:Negatechanges-Step-by-stepguide">Step-by-step guide</h2>
        <p>Process for negating changes is different for stored logic and ddl/dml code.</p>
        <h3 id="HowTo:Negatechanges-Changesin&quot;data_dml&quot;,&quot;ddl&quot;,&quot;ddl_direct&quot;,&quot;sql&quot;,or&quot;sql_direct&quot;folders">Changes in "data_dml", "ddl", "ddl_direct", "sql", or "sql_direct" folders</h3>
        <p>We will assume that a script by the name of "<code>international_billing.sql</code>" was packaged from "sql_direct" directory. This script created several tables. One of those tables "<code>international_billing_custom</code>" is not needed. Steps below will guide you how to negate this change, i.e., drop table international_billing_custom</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Commit a negating script. Since this script simply performs a "drop table" operation, this script can be committed into the "ddl" directory.&#160;
				<ol><li>From naming convention perspective, you would want to name this script as something meaningful for users, e.g., "<code>drop_international_billing_custom_table.sql</code>".&#160;
						<ol><li>Notice that this will not result in net data loss when both "create table" and "drop table" are deployed to a target environment respectively.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
            <li>Datical will package negating scripts into changesets.<br /><ol><li>Note that the changeset will inherit a label based on the script name. This could be useful later when reviewing status, forecast or deploy reports.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Because the negating script was packaged in a later commit relative to the initial script, Datical will deploy the negating script in the same order as the SCM commit.
				<ol><li>For example, when deploying changes to PROD environment, Datical will deploy all changesets from the originating script ("<code>international_billing.sql</code>"). This will also create the unwanted table in PROD. Datical will then proceed with deploying other changesets including the negating changeset which will remove the unwanted table "<code><span>international_billing_custom</span></code>" from PROD.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Best Practice:<br />Prior to deploying your changes to the target environment, especially when deploying to PROD, run a Forecast to check that negating changesets are getting picked up by your release labels and deployed in the correct order.</p>
        <h3 id="HowTo:Negatechanges-Changesin&quot;procedure&quot;,&quot;function&quot;,&quot;package&quot;,&quot;packagebody&quot;,&quot;trigger&quot;and&quot;view&quot;storedlogicfolders">
            <br />Changes in "procedure", "function", "package", "packagebody", "trigger" and "view" stored logic folders</h3>
        <p>Note: Scripts committed into one of these directories <u>do not move to the "archive" directory</u>. All stored logic scripts stay in their original directories after packaging.</p>
        <p>We will assume that a script by the name of "<code>international_customer_dependents.sql</code>" was packaged from the "procedure" directory. This script contains code for a procedure "<code>intl_cust_dep</code>". Because the original script has been packaged already, there exists a Datical changeset for this procedure. During testing, you realize that the procedure needs to be fixed. Steps below will guide you how to package a fix for this procedure.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Since scripts in the "procedure" directory do not get archived, the original faulty script is already exists in that directory.</li>
            <li>The Developer will checkout the script from SCM</li>
            <li>Rework the script.</li>
            <li>Commit the reworked script using the same file name and in the same directory where it was originally placed ("procedure").</li>
            <li>Packager will detect a new commit in the "procedure" directory. As a result, a second changeset will be created for the same procedure.</li>
            <li>Because the reworked script was packaged in a later commit relative to the original faulty script, Datical will deploy the reworked script in the same order as the SCM commit.
				<ol><li>For example, when deploy changes to PROD environment, Datical will deploy the first changeset for&#160;"<code>intl_cust_dep</code>" procedure. This will create the procedure in PROD with faulty code. Datical will then proceed with deploying other changesets including the reworked changeset which will update the procedure with new code.</li></ol></li>
