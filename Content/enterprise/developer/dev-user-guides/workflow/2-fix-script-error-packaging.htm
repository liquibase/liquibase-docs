        <h1>2.0. Fix a script error found during packaging
			<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" /></h1>
        <p>A packaging job can fail for many reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Errors in the script</li>
            <li>Changes already exist into the target database - maybe because someone deployed those changes manually</li>
            <li>Dependent changes don't yet exist in the target database
				<ul><li>Review the <a href="2-fix-script-error-packaging.htm">Processing Order</a> for how Datical will determine in which order to deploy scripts</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to understand which stage of the workflow your error occurred in. The console output of the packager job can help you distinguish each stage</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Packaging stage</li>
            <li>Forecast stage</li>
            <li>Deploy stage</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Review these troubleshooting documents to assess how to fix your errors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="2-fix-script-error-packaging.htm">Troubleshooting: Environment Issues</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="2-fix-script-error-packaging.htm">Troubleshooting: Remediation Process - Issues with Packaging</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="2-fix-script-error-packaging.htm">Troubleshooting: Remediation Process - Issues with Forecast or Deploy</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To address non-environmental errors, please review your scripts you checked in earlier and apply necessary fixes. Then check-in your changes to SQL repo again. This will trigger the Datical packaging job again.</p>
