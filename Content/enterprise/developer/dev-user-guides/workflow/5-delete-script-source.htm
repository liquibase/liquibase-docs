        <h1>5.0. What happens when I delete a script from source control?
			<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" /></h1>
        <p>When you delete a script from the SQL repository, <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> will act on it differently based on which directory the script was in. </p>
        <h3>The Stored Logic directories (procedure, function, package, packagebody, trigger, view)</h3>
        <p>Prior to release 6.17 deleting a file from the SQL code repository that contained a stored logic object definition that had previously been packaged would result in a change set being added to the changelog.xml that dropped that object. If you are on a version of Datical prior to 6.17, BE CAREFUL! Deleting a stored logic script will perform a DROP operation on the object.</p>
        <p>As of Datical 6.17, deleting a stored logic file from the SQL code repository will no longer result in a drop of that object being added to the change log. File deletion will be noted in the log, but won't have any effect on the Datical Project. To generate a change set to drop a stored logic object in version 6.17 and subsequent releases replace the object definition in the file with a valid <code>drop</code>SQL statement for that object.</p>
        <h3>The <code>ddl</code>, <code>ddl_direct</code>, <code>data_dml</code>, <code>sql</code>, and <code>sql_direct</code> directories</h3>
        <p>Scripts in these directories automatically get archived after successful packaging job.</p>
        <p>However, there could be use cases where packager job runs only once a day and during the day developers could check in a number of scripts. A developer may delete a script with the understanding that the script was never packaged.</p>
        <p>There could also be a use case where a script is failing during packaging and it prevents other scripts from packaging. Therefore, the failing script needs to be removed so that other scripts can proceed with packaging.</p>
        <p>In these use cases, it is safe to delete <code>ddl</code>, <code>ddl_direct</code>, <code>data_dml</code>, <code>sql</code>, and <code>sql_direct</code> scripts. When packager runs, it will see that a script was removed/deleted from SQL repo and it will no longer package those scripts.</p>
        <p>Never delete scripts from the "archive" directory.</p>
