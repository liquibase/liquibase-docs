        <p>As you make changes to your stored logic scripts in your DEV or INT environment, you will want to decide whether to deploy all versions of your changes sequentially or deploy only the latest.</p>
        <p>The default behavior is to deploy all versions sequentially. This means that when you are ready to deploy your changes to the next environment (say, QA), <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> will, by default, deploy all versions of scripts ending with the latest version.</p>
        <p>If for some reason you do not want to deploy all versions of the stored logic, and instead it is necessary to only deploy the latest version, then you will need to specify<code>versionStrategy=deployLatest</code>in metadata.properties file.Review <a href="4-deploy-latest-version-stored-logic.htm" rel="nofollow">How To: Leverage the "metadata.properties" file</a> for more information on metadata.properties file.</p>
