        <p><strong>Pipeline Merge</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
				-ignore and -unignore files
				<ul><li>No action. When these files are detected in a pipeline merge, they are skipped and no action taken. These files did not create a new changeSet, they modified an existing changeSet. That changeset is merged independently of the -ignore and -unignore files.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
				-cleanup and -replace files
				<ul><li>A new pipeline label is applied to the merged files. The files to merge should match on origFilePath and origFileName and then on checksum. If multiple changeSets match on origFilePath and origFileName, then only those matching on checksum (one or more changesets) are be merged, applying the new pipeline label. If no changeSets match on origFilePath &amp; origFileName, then the merge fails with an error message stating that a file was found in the archive folder but no changesets could be matched.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Feature merge</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A feature merge adds a specified context attribute to the merged changesets. It does not package any new changeSets found on the branch.</li>
            <li>Feature merge behavior is identical to pipeline merge behavior for -ignore, -unignore, -cleanup, and -replace files.</li>
        </ul>
