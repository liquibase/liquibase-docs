        <h1>Get Started with <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> as a Developer</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p>Several elements directly impact the developer workflow with <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" />. Those elements include scripts, metadata.properties files, and packaging. Understanding the behavior and functionality of each of these items are essential to your success. The following documents are designed to help you use <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" />.</p>
        <p>Specifically, you need to know what folders hold scripts, how to inspect a script if it fails to run, what happens to scripts, and where they are written from. Metadata.properties are also vital to the Enterprise workflow. Developers need to understand the rules in which metadata.properties files are written, and how to read and inspect the metadata.properties file to find out the folder structure. Understanding how packaging works for the DBA and how that affects the Developer workflow is also a key component. You will find each of these topics covered in detail below.</p>
