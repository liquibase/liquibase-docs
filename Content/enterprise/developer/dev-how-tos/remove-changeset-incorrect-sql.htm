        <h1>How To: Remove a <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" /> that has incorrect SQL

        <h2 id="HowTo:RemoveaChangeSetthathasincorrectSQL-Overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>If a change set fails when you attempt to deploy it because of an error in the SQL, you may want to remove that change set from your changelog. Removing the change set will avoid deploying or attempting to deploy that change set during future deployments.</p>
        <h2 id="HowTo:RemoveaChangeSetthathasincorrectSQL-Instructions">Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open your project in the Liquibase Enterprise desktop client:</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove01.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get the latest version of the project from SCM (source control). For example., "git pull".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the "Design" tab:</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove02.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the Design tab, locate the specific change set that you want to remove and highlight it:</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove03.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right-click and choose "Remove":</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove04.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now you can see that change set was removed from the changelog:</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove05.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you are done removing change sets, save your modified changelog. Go up to the "File" menu in the top left and select "Save":</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove05b.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After saving your changes, click on the "Plan" tab to return to the main view of your project:</p>
                <img src="../../../Z_Resources/Images/enterprise/remove-incorrect-changeset/remove06.jpg" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Commit and push your project back to SCM (source control) because your changelog.xml file has been modified. For example, "git commit ..." followed by "git push".</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You are finished! Removing the change set from your changelog prevents it from being deployed or attempting to be deployed to any of your Liquibase Enterprise environments.</p>
