        <h2>About projects</h2>
        <p>A project defines the work flow of database changes through release stages and typically maps to a defined scope of development work. For example, a project can be defined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a collection of applications that share the same database</li>
            <li>As an application</li>
            <li>As a part of an application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Projects can also be made up of one or more pipelines with each pipeline representing a discrete development process. They are often subdivided by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current Release</li>
            <li>Next Release</li>
            <li>Hotfix</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, they are not limited by those subdivisions. Pipelines can also be mapped to development work represented in branches in a Source Control Management repository.</p>
        <h2>Viewing projects</h2>
        <p>To view a project, click on the <b>My Projects</b> tab in the left navigation menu, and select a project of your choice from the list.</p>
        <div class="img-zoom-container" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../../../Z_Resources/Images/Assets/Screenshots/Use/myprojectview.png" title="Click to Enlarge" alt="Image of the My Projects View in the DMC" />
        </div>
        <p>Clicking into a project will take you to the <MadCap:xref href="../../../dmc/use/project-pipeline-view.htm">Project Status View</MadCap:xref> which will consist of a list of all your pipelines.</p>
        <p>At the top of the page, there is a search projects field which allows you to filter through all projects your administrator has allowed you to view.</p>
