        <h3>Same <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> Version for All Users Working on a Release Pipeline</h3>
        <p>For any given release pipeline, all users that deploy changes to the pipeline should use the same version of <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" />. This requirement applies to all users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual Users – Users have <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> installed on their system. They use the GUI client or CLI to perform operations (package, deploy, status, rollback).</li>
            <li>Automation – An automation solution (like Jenkins) uses a <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> installation. The automation system runs <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> CLI commands to perform operations (package, deploy, status, rollback).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Same Database Version for All Databases in a Release Pipeline</h3>
        <p>It is best practice to have all dbDef steps in a release pipeline running the same version of the database platform. The version of the database should be consistent to provide a consistent experience when the same changes are deployed to each dbDef step in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>If you need to use different database versions, ensure that the REF database is running the database version that matches the earliest database version in the pipeline. This way, you can avoid the situation when REF is a newer database version where changesets are created with newer attributes that may not be recognized by the earlier database versions in your pipeline.</p>
        <p>Each step in a project represents a stage in the release pipeline. A step in <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> software is also known as a dbDef, a connection, a target, or an environment.</p>
        <h2>DMC</h2>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> 7.x and DMC (Deployment Monitoring Console) Version Matching
		</h3>
        <p>DMC (Deployment Monitoring Console) 7.x versions typically need to match your <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> 7.x version. There are a few exceptions for versions where there was a <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> release but no correlating release for DMC. Please see the "<MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> and Deployment Monitoring Console Compatability Matrix" here: <a class="external-link" href="https://dmc.datical.com/release-notes/release-notes-home.htm" rel="nofollow">https://dmc.datical.com/release-notes/release-notes-home.htm</a></p>
        <h2 id="DaticalDBVersionRequirements-DaticalDB5.x/6.xandDaticalServiceVersionMatching"><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> 5.x/6.x and <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /> Version Matching</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /> 5.x/6.x includes an optional internal installation of <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> that is run by an internal Jenkins client. If you use <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /> and also use the internal Jenkins Client option, you need to use the same version of <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> and <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" />. However, if you do NOT use the Internal Jenkins Client you can run <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> 6.17 with <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /> versions 5.8 to 6.17. <MadCap:variable name="General.DMCProductShortName" /> versions 5.x/6.x have been deprecated.</p>
