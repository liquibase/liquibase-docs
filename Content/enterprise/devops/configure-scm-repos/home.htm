        <h1>Overview of SCM Setup
			<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" /></h1>
        <p>Using a Source Code Management system enables an automated database-change workflow.</p>
        <p>When SQL code is checked in, a trigger or polling mechanism can automatically start a packaging process, which refactors the SQL code files and deploys the resulting changesets to the REF database.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>A project (also called a Deployment Plan) defines the workflow that SQL code goes through and the database connections for each stage (step) in the workflow.</p>
        <p>You can use different methods to place a project file hierarchy into source control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly from local files - Check in the files for the project. The specific method varies by SCM system. You may choose to share database code in the same repository as application code or have it reside in its own repository.</li>
            <li>Datical GUI - Right-click on a project, then select Team &gt; Share Project. You then select your SCM system and provide more information</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SQL Code</h2>
        <p>In order to package SQL scripts for deployment, you must set up your SCM for SQL code. SQL scripts are packaged directly from the SCM.</p>
        <p>The Deployment Packager requires a set of folders named as follows.</p><pre class="conf-macro output-block" xml:space="preserve">&lt;sql_code_dir&gt; # for example, sql_scripts
