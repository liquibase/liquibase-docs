        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> supports Editioning Views. No special handling or configuration is required.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Oracle user (schema) must have ENABLE EDITIONS assigned. See <a class="external-link" href="https://oracle-base.com/articles/11g/edition-based-redefinition-11gr2" rel="nofollow">Oracle documentation</a>.</p>
        <h2>Editioning Views in Oracle</h2>
        <p>An editioning view is very much like any other view, except that it allows for the definition of more types of triggers on the view.  It allows this because Editioning Views take the place of tables in an environment where Edition Based Redefinition is being used. In these environments, the editioning view is "like an API to the base table."</p><pre>create table payment_manager.TESTING_B ( &#160;PAYMENT_STATUS_ID NUMBER, &#160;NAME VARCHAR2(64), &#160;DESCRIPTION VARCHAR2(512), &#160;CREATION_DATE TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE, &#160;MODIFY_DATE TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE
			); 
		CREATE OR REPLACE EDITIONING VIEW payment_manager.TESTING AS &#160;SELECT PAYMENT_STATUS_ID,    NAME,    DESCRIPTION,    CREATION_DATE,    MODIFY_DATE &#160;FROM payment_manager.TESTING_B;</pre>
        <h2>Enabling Editions</h2>
        <p>Editions must be enabled on the user (schema owner).</p><pre>ALTER USER &lt;user&gt; ENABLE EDITIONS;</pre>
        <h2>Permissions for Editions</h2>
        <p>A user must have permissions to create and drop editions. Add these permissions to the Datical role.</p><pre>GRANT CREATE ANY EDITION TO &lt;role_or_user&gt;;
		GRANT DROP ANY EDITION TO &lt;role_or_user&gt;;</pre>
        <h2>Datical Support for Editioning Views</h2>
        <p>Datical supports the following operations for editioning views:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Package SQL scripts (including snapshot and diff)</li>
            <li>Diffchangelog (generate editioning-view changesets from the result)</li>
            <li>Deploy</li>
            <li>Drop</li>
        </ul>
