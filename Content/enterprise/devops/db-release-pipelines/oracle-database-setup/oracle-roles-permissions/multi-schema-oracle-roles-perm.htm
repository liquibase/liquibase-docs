        <h1>Multi-Schema Projects - Oracle Roles and Permissions</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <h2>Multi-Schema Project Database Accounts, Roles and Permissions</h2>
        <p>Two datical database accounts are required for multi-schema projects. These accounts are referred to as DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING. At runtime, <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> will connect to the database as the DATICAL_USER to process and deploy code. The DATICAL_TRACKING schema owns the DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK tables used to track and manage database changes. The database change log tables are created in the default tablespace assigned to the DATICAL_TRACKING account. The database account names must be the same across all databases in the pipeline. The DATICAL_USER and DATICAL_TRACKING accounts should not be one of the managed schemas in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Database permissions for <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> are managed through Roles. Three <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> Roles are needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DATICAL_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to deploy objects to the managed schemas.</li>
            <li>DATICAL_PACKAGER_ROLE - Required only on the REF database in the project. Grants additional permissions required to execute <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> packaging operations.</li>
            <li>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to manage the database change log.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">Multi-schema projects require the DATICAL_USER account to have elevated privileges because the account is used to create objects in each of the schemas managed by Liquibase.</p>

        <h2>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE for Permissions on the Tracking Tables</h2>
        <p>In a multi-schema project you typically define a separate schema for the tracking tables. The DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE permissions are needed on that schema.</p><b>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE</b><pre>CREATE ROLE DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE NOT IDENTIFIED;

        <h2>DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR Creation</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> uses datapump as the default mechanism to backup and restore database schemas during Packaging. The DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR is only needed on the REF databases. Edit the script to set the path for the DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR to an appropriate location on the database server.</p><b>DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR</b><pre>-- Modify this to set the appropriate directory path.

        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">To use Data Pump in an Oracle RAC configuration, you must ensure that the directory object path (DATICAL_DATAPUMP_DIR by default) is on a cluster-wide file system. The directory object must point to shared physical storage that is visible to, and accessible from, all instances where Data Pump and/or external tables processes may run.</p><pre>;</pre>
        <h2>Granting Roles and Permissions</h2>
