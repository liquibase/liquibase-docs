        <h1>Single-Schema Projects - Oracle Roles and Permissions</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p>For single-schema projects the DATICAL_USER is the managed schema account. At runtime, <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> will connect to the database as the owner of the managed schema to process and deploy code. The DATABASECHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK tables used to track and manage database changes are deployed into the managed schema. The database schemas can be different across steps in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Database permissions for <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> are managed through Roles. Three <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> Roles are needed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DATICAL_SCHEMA_OWNER_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to deploy objects.</li>
            <li>DATICAL_PACKAGER_SCHEMA_OWNER_ROLE - Required only on the REF database in the project. Grants additional permissions required to execute <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> packaging operations.</li>
            <li>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE - Required on all databases in the project. Grants permissions to manage the database change log.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Single-SchemaProjects-OracleRolesandPermissions-DATICAL_SCHEMA_OWNER_ROLE">DATICAL_SCHEMA_OWNER_ROLE</h2>
        <p>This role gives the <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> user the required permissions on all managed database objects.</p><b>DATICAL_ROLE_SCHEMA_OWNER</b><pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" xml:space="preserve">-- The following must be run as sysdba
