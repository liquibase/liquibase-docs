        <h2><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> Project Requirements</h2>
        <p>When you configure a project, you provide</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Configure connection information (URL and port). You need the database information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Configure credentials (user name and password) and credential options. You need the username and password you created in the database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Connection settings (some are unique to a database type)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database Users</h2>
        <p>There are many options in setting up database user management.</p>
        <h3>Assigning a Service User</h3>
        <p>You can create a service user for every database.</p>
        <h3>Assigning Roles to Individual Users</h3>
        <p>If you need to you individual users rather than a service user, you can create roles and then assign them to individual users.</p>
        <h2>Database Password Requirements</h2>
        <p>Available Characters for Database Passwords</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All alphabetic characters:<strong>a-z and A-Z</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>All numeric characters: <strong>0-9</strong></p>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Errors when packaging scripts in the sql_direct,ddl_direct, and sqlplus folders, or from folders that have packageMethod=direct andpackageMethod=ddl_direct. Errors when deploying any scripts that were packaged from the sql_direct,&#160;ddl_direct, and sqlplus folders, or from folders that have packageMethod=direct and packageMethod=ddl_direct.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Errors when packaging scripts in the data_dml folder or from folders that have packageMethod=data_dml. Errors when deploying any scripts that were packaged from the data_dml folder or from folders that have packageMethod=data_dml.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Errors deploying "Execute with SQLPlus", "Execute with SQLCMD", "Execute with CLPPLus", or "Execute with psql" change set types.</p>
            </li>

        <h2 id="ImplementationGuide:SettingUpDatabasePermissions-SuggestedRolesforDaticalUserAccounts">
			Suggested Roles for <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> User Accounts</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> recommends that clients create up to 4 database roles for use by the user accounts that are used to connect to the database using <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" />.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_ROLE</strong> - Used in all databases.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_PACKAGER_ROLE</strong> - Used only in the reference / packaging database. Has additional permissions required to access the trace file and perform backup &amp; restore.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_ROLE_SCHEMA_OWNER</strong> – (Oracle, single-schema only). Used for when connecting as the schema owner.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_PACKAGER_SCHEMA_OWNER</strong> - (Oracle, single-schema only). Used only in the reference / packaging database. Used for when connecting as the schema owner.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_TRACK_ROLE</strong> – Used in all databases to create and update the <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> tracking tables.</p>
        <p><strong>DATICAL_AUDIT_ROLE</strong> – Used in the AuditDB to create and update the <MadCap:variable name="General.LBEnterprise" /> audit tables.</p>
        <h2>Specifying Database Credentials</h2>
        <p>Project settings determine whether database credentials are stored in the project or resolved dynamically through environment variables or a user prompt.&#160;<span class="Strong_2">We strongly recommend using runtime credentials because it is more secure than stored credentials.</p>
