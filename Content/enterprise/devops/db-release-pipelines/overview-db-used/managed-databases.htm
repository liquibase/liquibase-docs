        <h1>Managed Database Setup</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/images/icon-enterprise-top.flsnp" />
        <p>A managed database is any database after the REF database in the release pipeline. The REF database is always first in the pipeline.</p>
        <h2>Managed Database Setup</h2>
        <p>Before you create a Datical project and steps, the following database setup is needed. Set up each database in the release pipeline.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure users, roles, and permissions.</li>
            <li>Configure database-specific facilities (such as Oracle Auto-Permissions and Auto-Synonyms, or enabling Integrated Security connections on SQL Server).</li>
            <p>See the sections for each database platform for details.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database Information to Use When Creating Projects</h2>
        <ul> <p>When you create a project and steps, you do the following:</p><li>Configure connection information (URL and port). You need the database information.</li><li>Configure credentials (user name and password) and credential options. You need the username and password you created in the database.   Datical DB obtains connection user/password information from one of these two methods below.</li> </ul>
        <p class="note">We strongly recommend to use the first method (runtime credentials) because it is more secure.  The second option (storing credentials in the datical.project file) is to be avoided because of the possibility of the encoded passwords being decoded.  
			
			</p>
        <p>Credential options include:
			</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Option 1: Runtime credentials (more secure)</li>
            <p>Prompt during project operations</p>
            <p>Store in environment variables</p>
            <li>Option 2: Store in the datical.project file (less secure)</li>
            <p>Passwords are encoded</p>
            <p>Configure connection settings (some are unique to a database type/platform)</p>
        </ul>
