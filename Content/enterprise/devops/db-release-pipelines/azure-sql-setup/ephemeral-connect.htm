        <h1>The ephemeralConnectionRetryTimeout property for Azure SQL Database</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/images/.ver_icon_size_enterprise.flsnp" />
        <p>The process of <code>Ephemeral</code> database copying takes time. In the process of copying, the connection to the database cannot be obtained because the database is being replicated. <MadCap:variable name="General.DaticalDB" /> includes the <code>ephemeralConnectionRetryTimeout</code> property for <code>Packager</code>, which defines an overall time to get the connection to the <code>Ephemeral</code> database instance after the backup operation is executed. The default value for the property is 20 minutes, however, the replication may take more time and you may want to set a retry time-out that is applicable for your configuration.</p>
        <p>To configure the retry time-out, open the <code>deployPackager.properties</code> file and set the <code>ephemeralConnectionRetryTimeout</code> property. The valid time value to set is from one minute to one day (1440 minutes).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the connection to the <code>Ephemeral</code> database is not obtained after the specified retry time-out, the <code>Packager</code> will delete the <code>Ephemeral</code> database and will fail.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the connection to the <code>Ephemeral</code> database is obtained less than the retry time-out you specified, then the packaging process will continue.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">There is a sample <code>deployPackager.properties</code> file provided in <code>DaticalDB/repl/scripts</code>. For more information about <code>deployPackager.properties</code> and <code>ephemeralConnectionRetryTimeout</code>, see <a href="../../best-practices/required-deploy-packager-properties.htm">Using the Required deployPackager.properties File</a>.</p>
