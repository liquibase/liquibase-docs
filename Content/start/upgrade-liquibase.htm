        <h1>Upgrade <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /></h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> is a mission-critical component in your organization's deployment process, so any upgrades should be planned and verified carefully before rollout. The <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> engineering team invests heavily in our extensive test suite, but we recommend that you follow these steps when upgrading to ensure the best possible experience for your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> user community.</p>
        <h2>Plan your upgrade</h2>
        <p>Planning your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> upgrade should include the following elements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Review the <MadCap:xref href="release-notes/liquibase-release-notes/home.htm">[%=General.Liquibase%] Release Notes</MadCap:xref>.</b>&#160;<MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> documents all changes that may change the user experience or how <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />s are processed. You should review your existing <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> usage to determine if you are impacted by these changes.<ul><li>The release notes also include notification of any third-party database drivers included in <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> along with a link to that driver's release notes. You should also review the release notes of any database drivers that you use in your environment.</li><li>You should also consider upgrading <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> extensions (such as the <a href="tutorials/mongodb-pro/home.htm">MongoDB extension</a>) as a part of your upgrade of <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> core. You should also review the release notes for these extensions.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Create or update your upgrade validation plan.</b> Your validation plan for upgrading <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> should cover any use-cases which are critical to your organization’s use of <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />. While the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> engineering team has an extensive test suite covering all <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />-maintained database drivers, you should validate the upgrade in the context of your specific environment.</li>
            <p>Here are some specific use-cases you may want to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Running <code><MadCap:xref href="../commands/change-tracking/status.htm">status</MadCap:xref></code>, <code><MadCap:xref href="../commands/change-tracking/history.html">history</MadCap:xref></code>, and <code><MadCap:xref href="../commands/update/update.html">update</MadCap:xref></code> commands against your supported databases in a test region.</li>
                <li>Performing <a href="../workflows/liquibase-community/using-rollback.htm">rollbacks</a>.</li>
                <li>Running <a href="../tools-integrations/observability/operation-reports-drift-report.htm">drift reports</a></li>
                <li>Executing your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />&#160;<MadCap:xref href="../commands/quality-checks/home.htm">Quality Checks</MadCap:xref></li>
                <li>Verifying reporting of <MadCap:xref href="../tools-integrations/observability/structured-logging.htm">[%=General.StructuredLogging%]</MadCap:xref> to your observability tool.</li>
                <li>Include coverage of <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />&#160;<MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> patterns which are in use in your environment.</li>
                <li>Validate dependencies with third-party <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> extensions.</li>
                <li>Validate integrations into your enterprise tools such as ServiceNow or other release tracking systems necessitated by regulations in your industry.</li>
                <li>Other use-cases that your team needs to handle, such as multi-schema deployments or multi-database deployments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You should also use the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> release notes to guide the creation of additional use-cases. We recommend that you set up these test cases as jobs in your CI/CD system so that you can execute them automatically for each upgrade.</p>
            <li><b>Obtain the updated <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> release.</b> You can obtain the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> release artifacts from the <a href="https://www.liquibase.com/download">download page</a>. The <a href="../workflows/liquibase-community/using-liquibase-and-docker.htm"><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Docker</a> image is also updated for every release. If you have extended the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Docker image, you will need to build a new version of that image to use in your testing and rollout.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">We advise you <b>not</b> to use the <code>latest</code> tag of the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Docker image. Instead, you should reference the specific version you have tested in your upgrade process. Using the <code>latest</code> tag will automatically upgrade your pipelines and result in unplanned and untested upgrades.</p>
            <p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;"><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> versions 4.22.0 through 4.23.1 have known issues with checksums and deploying updates with <a href="../concepts/changelogs/attributes/runwith.htm">native executors</a>. For best results, please download and use the <a href="release-notes/liquibase-release-notes/liquibase-4.23.2.htm"><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> 4.23.2 release</a> or newer.</p>
            <li><b>Determine your rollout plan.</b> In smaller environments, a simple rollout strategy of upgrading <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> for all pipelines at once may be sufficient. In larger environments, it is wise to perform a progressive rollout. In a progressive rollout, you upgrade <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> for a subset of your pipelines before applying the upgrade to the rest. By not upgrading all users simultaneously, you can identify problems before they create emergencies or failed production deployments for large numbers of teams.</li>
            <li><b>Notify <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support.</b> As a part of your upgrade planning process, you should <a href="https://support.liquibase.com/knowledge/working-with-support">notify <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> support</a> about your plan to upgrade. Please include your test plan and rollout plan. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support will review your plan and provide feedback on it to you. Please also include your planned upgrade window so that our support team is prepared to respond appropriately. Keep in mind that responses to any support incidents will be bound by your <a href="https://www.liquibase.com/support">support subscription’s service level agreement</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Notify your user-community.</b> Notify your user-community about the upgrade in advance of the upgrade window. Note any changes that may affect their usage of <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />.</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">You should advise your users to verify any planned production deployments by running the <code><MadCap:xref href="../commands/update/update-sql.htm">update-sql</MadCap:xref></code> command well ahead of their production deployment using the <code><MadCap:xref href="../commands/update/update.html">update</MadCap:xref></code> command. This will allow them to verify that their <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />s are valid and that only the expected changes will be deployed when the <code>update</code> command is finally run.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Upgrade rollout support activities</h2>
        <p>We recommend that you develop a post-upgrade support plan for any issues identified during the rollout of the <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> upgrade. We suggest the following best-practices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Establish an internal support process.</b> This may vary according to your existing practices, but we recommend that you have an internal chat channel where users can raise concerns in real-time and where you can communicate the status of the rollout. This can be combined with a ticketing system to ensure issues are worked to resolution.</li>
            <li><b>Document your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support contact plan.</b> You should document how your team should interact with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support. We recommend that you designate certain individuals to interact with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support so that any issues raised include all necessary information and that your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> administration team has visibility into all reported issues. You should ensure these persons have access to the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support portal so that they can directly raise issues with the <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> support team.</li>
            <p>Your support plan should also note your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> support level and hours of support as per your <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> service level agreement, along with instructions on <a href="https://support.liquibase.com/knowledge/creating-a-support-ticket">how to open a support ticket</a> and what information should be included. You should also provide guidance on how to open and manage an <a href="https://support.liquibase.com/knowledge/what-should-i-do-if-i-have-an-urgent-issue-sev1-or-sev2">Urgent issue with <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Support</a>.</p>
        </ol>
