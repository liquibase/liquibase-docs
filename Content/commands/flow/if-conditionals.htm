        <p><code>if</code>&#160;conditionals allow you to set specific blocks of code to run or not run depending on your <MadCap:xref href="flow.htm">flow</MadCap:xref> file functionality needs.</p>

        <h2><code>if</code>&#160;conditionals code format</h2>
        <p>If conditionals exist within their own block of code within a Stage in a Flow file. A few formatting rules to note are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire conditional must be encompassed by "quotes".</li>
            <li>Variables must begin with <code>$</code> and be encompassed by {curly braces}.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p><pre><code class="language-text">if:&#160;"${LIQUIBASE_ACTIVE_TARGET} == dev"</code></pre>
        <p>Any defined variable can be used as a conditional, including environment variables and global variables.</p>

        <h2>Implement <code>if</code> conditionals</h2>
        <p>Values within <code>if</code> conditionals are called on in the format below. If the conditional value is set to <code>true</code>, it will run the command. If the conditional value is set to <code>false</code>, it will not run the command.</p>

        <p>When <code>liquibase flow</code> runs,  messages will appear in the CLI after the flow file executes each section. Notice in the sample message below it says <code>Executing 'liquibase' checks run</code> because the environment variable above is set to true. You will also notice the message <code>Skipping action:&#160;'liquibase' updatesql because condition 'dev != dev' evaluated to false.'</code> This is the best location to find why <code>if</code>&#160;conditionals did or did not run successfully. If you expected a conditional to run successfully and it did not, you are better equipped to adjust the flow file accordingly.</p>
