        <p>The <code>RegexNegLookAhead</code> check is a pre-written Regex quality check that allows <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to look for a positive pattern based on two user-provided inputs. This check is pre-configured so users do not have to hand write regex's to look forward in their <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />.</p>
        <p>This check triggers when the user-supplied regular expression for a primary match <b>is not followed</b> by a user-supplied regex 'negative lookahead' match.</p>
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>The <code>RegexNegLookAhead</code> check can be used to confirm conditions within the <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />. This check allows you to check for specific patterns in your <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" /> and then produce a logged record of changeset structure when  certain conditions are met. When it is executed successfully the checks message is logged to the console and logs as proof that changesets conform to specific standards.</p>
        <h2>Run the RegexNegLookAhead check</h2>
        <p>To run the <code>RegexNegLookAhead</code> check, ensure you have a Liquibase Pro license and the <code>checks-scope</code> property includes <code>changelog</code>. The <MadCap:xref href="../../command-arguments/checks-scope.htm">checks-scope</MadCap:xref> parameter is set in the default properties file, environment variable, or any standard method.<br /></p>
        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;"><b>NegLookAhead Logic:</b>
            <br />If regex pattern X exists then Pattern A <b>must not exist after</b> pattern X.</p>
        <p>In this example, you are ensuring that all instances of regex pattern X are not followed by regex pattern Y. When this check runs successfully, a log will be created that displays all instances when regex pattern X are not followed by regex pattern Y.</p>
        <p>Enable the <code class="language-text">regexLookAhead</code> check by running the following command in the CLI:<br /><code class="language-text">liquibase checks enable --check-name=regexLookAhead</code></p>
