        <h1>Use the Checks Settings Configuration File</h1>
        <p>The checks settings file lets you <b>customize</b> your <a href="../checks/home.htm">policy checks</a> for a specific project or to <b>share a configuration</b> across a team or organization. You can have multiple checks settings files and store them in source control or artifact repository for versioning, consistent use, and <a href="automation-severity-exit-code.htm">automation</a>.</p>
        <p>In Liquibase 4.25.0 and later, you can group together multiple checks settings files with a <b>checks package</b>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../checks-packages/home.htm">Policy Checks Packages</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The checks settings file can have the <code class="language-text">.conf</code> or <code class="language-text">.yaml</code> extension. By default, the file is called <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code>.</p>
        <h2>Create a checks settings file</h2>
        <p>To create a checks settings file <b>for the first time</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/text/checks-settings-file-create-new.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <p>Alternatively, enter <code class="language-text">2</code> to specify a custom name for your settings file.</p>
            <p>Either way, Liquibase enables some useful policy checks for you by default. You can modify which checks are active in your settings file by using some of the <a href="../../../commands/policy-checks/subcommands/home.htm">commands</a> described in the next step.</p>
            <li>If you want to create and customize an <b>additional checks settings file</b> after creating your initial file (<code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code>):</li>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Z_Resources/Snippets/text/checks-settings-file-create-new-additional.flsnp" />
        </ol>
        <p>You can further modify an existing checks settings file at any time. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../commands/policy-checks/subcommands/home.htm">Policy Checks Commands</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Use the checks settings file</h2>
        <p>You can run the policy checks that are enabled in your settings file by using the <code class="language-text"><a href="../../../commands/policy-checks/subcommands/run.htm">checks run</a></code> command:</p><pre><code class="language-text">liquibase checks run --checks-settings-file=my_file_name.yaml</code></pre>
        <p>Here are some tips to use your settings file:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To use the in-memory file while running <code class="language-text">run</code> or <code class="language-text">show</code>, enter <b>N</b> at runtime. Other commands require a checks settings file to save the changes for checks.</li>
            <li>To use a checks settings file customized for a specific environment or project, specify the name with the <code class="language-text">--checks-settings-file</code> parameter. If you do not specify this parameter, Liquibase uses the in-memory file or default settings file: <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code>.</li>
            <li>To group multiple checks settings files together and run them in a single <code class="language-text">run</code> or <code class="language-text">show</code> command, create a <a href="../checks-packages/home.htm">checks package</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Warning: &lt;/b&gt;"><b>Do not manually modify  the checks settings file</b> because it  may cause unrecoverable and unsupported errors. You should only modify the file with Liquibase commands.</p>
        <h2>Encoding changes between Liquibase 4.5.0 and 4.6.0</h2>
        <p>The checks settings file is <b>encoded</b> in Liquibase 4.5.0 and <b>unencoded</b> in Liquibase 4.6.0+. An unencoded file is easier to inspect and resolve merge conflicts with source control.</p>
        <p>When you use an encoded checks settings file from Liquibase 4.5.0  with Liquibase 4.6.0 or later versions, Liquibase will automatically back up your checks settings file  as <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf.v4.5</code> and update it.</p>
        <p>In most cases, you do not need to take any action. However, when you work in an environment in which a Liquibase 4.5.0 user cannot upgrade to version 4.6.0 and must use the same shared checks settings file, the Liquibase 4.5.0 user must specify the compliant checks settings file 4.5.0 by using <code class="language-text">--checks-settings-file=&lt;mybackedupfile.conf.v4.5&gt;</code>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you use Liquibase 4.5.0, you will have the encoded <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code> file and it will remain encoded so long as you use version 4.5.0.</li>
            <li>If you have Liquibase 4.6.0 or later versions when you start using policy checks, your first <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code> file will be unencoded by default.</li>
            <li>If you have Liquibase 4.6.0 or later versions and use an  encoded checks settings file 4.5.0, it will be backed up and unencoded automatically.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>File format</h3>
        <p>The <code class="language-text">liquibase.checks-settings.conf</code> internal file format has changed over time to simplify the process of managing the file in source control.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Liquibase 4.5.0, the file was encoded, which made it difficult to merge changes.</li>
            <li>In Liquibase 4.6.0 through Liquibase 4.23.0, this was remedied by changing the file to an unencoded proprietary format.</li>
            <li>In Liquibase 4.23.1 and later, the file format was changed to YAML for better readability and easier management. <b>It is still a best practice to use Liquibase commands to manage this file and never make manual edits.</b></li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The Liquibase 4.23.1+ file format is unreadable by 4.23.0 and earlier. If multiple users or pipelines share a checks settings file, you must install Liquibase 4.23.1+ for all users and pipelines that call on the file.</p>
        </ul>
