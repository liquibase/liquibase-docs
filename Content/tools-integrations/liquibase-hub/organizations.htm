        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Z_Resources/Snippets/note/HubEOL.flsnp" />
        <p>Organizations collect all elements used in the <a href="https://hub.liquibase.com/"><MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /></a> system, such as projects with  <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />s and their <MadCap:variable name="General.changeset" style="font-style: normal;" />s, targets, and operation reports, which are the data sent from <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> when it performs commands on a registered <MadCap:variable name="General.changelog" />.</p>
        <p>Organizations have one or more Admins, who can invite <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Hub users to become members. Members of an Organization can view and send Operations data to Projects within the Organization.</p>
        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>Any user who creates an Organization is the initial Organization Admin. When you join <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, it creates an Organization for you, and as its creator, you are its initial Admin.</p>
        <p>An Organization Admin can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assign and revoke an Organization Admin role to others in the Organization</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"> Any Organization Admin can make any other Organization member an Admin. All Admins have the same administration rights.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove other Organization Admins or Organization members</li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When you remove a member from an Organization, all API keys and roles for that user that are associated with the Organization are removed. Additionally, when you remove an Admin role, their member role remains.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Update the name, short name that represents  URL, description, and other meta properties of the Organization </li>
            <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">A short name does not support commas, spaces, underscores, or other special characters except for hyphens ( - ) and must be lowercase and unique across all organizations, such as <code>datical1</code>.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Invite users to the Organization and manage invitations sent to users</li>
            <li>See the Organization name, id, date created, and creator</li>
            <li>See the Projects, Admins, and Users with access to the Organization</li>
            <li>See and set the status <code>active</code> or <code>inactive</code> of the Organization</li>
            <li>Manage the membership and access to projects in the Organization from the <b>Members</b> page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip: &lt;/b&gt;">If you are an administrator for the Organization and want to delete your account, you will need to remove yourself as an administrator for this Organization. However, the last Admin cannot leave the Organization, although they can make the Organization inactive, which has the outcome of blocking all access to the Organization's elements.</p>
        <p>An Organization member can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new Project and see all the existing Projects of the Organization</li>
            <li>See the Organizations of which they are a member</li>
            <li>See other Organization members</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a user who does not belong to a specific Organization, you need to accept an invite sent by an Organization Admin to your email address.</p>
        <h2>Creating an Organization</h2>
        <p>Any user can create an Organization with Projects and invite others by their email address.</p>
        <p>To create a new Organization, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</li>
            <li>From the <b>Organizations</b> or <b>Projects</b> tab, select the dropdown menu in the upper-left corner labeled with your Organization's name.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Create an Organization</b>.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/tools-integrations/hub-organization-1.png" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Fill in the information about Organization name, primary contact email, Hub URL that will be used for creating a unique URL in <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, and description.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Create Organization</b> to complete the process.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Using an Organization</h2>
        <p>If you are an Organization Admin, you can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit Organization information </li>
            <li>Manage your API keys</li>
            <li>Invite, manage, and grant members an Admin role</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a member of multiple organizations, you can switch between organizations by selecting <b>Hub Organizations</b> and choosing the one you need.</p>
        <h2>Inviting users to an Organization</h2>
        <p>You need to be an Organization Admin to invite a user to your Organization:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Organizations</b> &gt; <b>Members</b> &gt; <b>Invite a New Member</b>.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/tools-integrations/hub-organization-2.png" />
            </p>
            <li>In the pop-up window, enter an email address of the user you want to invite and select <b>Submit</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As an Organization Admin, you can delete an open or expired invitation sent to a user. A default expiration time is seven days. To continue an expiration time, resend the invitation.</p>
        <p>On the <b>Invitations</b> page, you can also see a list of invitations sent to users along with the status, date, and creator of that invitation. You can also send additional invitations from this page.</p>
        <h2>Accepting the invitation to join an Organization</h2>
        <p>As a <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" /> user, you can easily accept an invitation to an Organization by entering a valid invitation code:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Me</b>  in the upper-right corner, and then select <b>Manage Organizations</b>.</li>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Z_Resources/Images/Screenshots/tools-integrations/hub-organization-3.png" />
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>On the <b>Manage Organizations</b> page, select <b>Join an Organization</b>. Enter the invitation code that you received via email and then select <b>Submit</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you do not see the email in your inbox,  check your Junk or spam folders.</p>
        <p>If the user is not registered in <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />, they can still be invited via email and will be prompted to sign up for <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</p>
        <h2>Managing API keys for multiple Organizations</h2>
        <p>As an Organization member or Admin, you will have a specific API key which ties you to the Projects and other data of the Organization. If you are in three Organizations, you need to manage three API Keys.</p>
        <p>Ensure you use the correct API Key when running commands that you want to report to <MadCap:variable name="General.Hub" />.</p>
