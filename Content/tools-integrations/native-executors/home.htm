        <h1>Introduction to Native Executors</h1>
        <h2>Database Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>Native executors offer powerful capabilities for different stakeholders. There may be <b>multiple stakeholders</b> involved when deploying changes to a database:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stakeholders that are concerned with the time it takes to get the changes deployed.</li>
            <li>Stakeholders that are tasked with keeping the database running at optimum performance.</li>
            <li>Stakeholders who are responsible for database standards and developing processes for applying database changes.</li>
            <li>In highly regulated industries, stakeholders who must ensure that each deployment is logged and tracked.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Native Executors</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> <b>primarily uses JDBC drivers</b> to connect and deploy changesets to target databases. But, there are instances when the JDBC driver is not sufficient to process <b>highly specialized</b> SQL.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /> extends the ability to deploy changesets using <b>native database clients</b> so during execution time, a native executor is invoked for changesets that request it to deploy a payload to a target database.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">For certain commands and administrative tasks <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /> will always use the JDBC driver.</p>
        <h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
        <p>Native database clients have been in use for a long time. Think "sqlplus" for Oracle or "sqlcmd" for SQL Server database. Developers and DBA's have become familiar with these tools and can adapt their SQL code for their database client. <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" /></p>
        <p>Experienced users understand the output of these tools and expect execution logs detailing the deployed SQL when requesting database deployments.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">These details are not visible when deploying with a JDBC driver.</p>
        <h3>Running SQL with <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /></h3>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> update command deploys the SQL payload and queries the database to understand what it needs to deploy based on previous deployments.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> can perform SQL payload deployment using either a JDBC driver or a native executor.</p>

        </p>
        <p>With <MadCap:variable name="General.LBPro" />, deciding whether to use a JDBC driver, or native executor is configurable by the developer who authors the database changesets. The author can add a tag on the changeset level to use a native executor. Without this tag, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> will default to using the JDBC driver.</p>
