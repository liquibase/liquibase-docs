        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> Observability enables users to share encapsulated information about <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> operations across teams with clear organization so users can make informed decisions that affect their database. Integrating <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> into the automation, observability, analysis, and productivity systems allows us to create a complete tapestry of modern software delivery.</p>

            <MadCap:xref href="structured-logging.htm">Structured Logging</MadCap:xref> makes <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> operation data easily available for monitoring and analysis tools to read, query, and act upon in automated workflows. This feature improves the way <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> logs its actions and events to make records machine-readable, easily-ingested, and queryable by industry-standard observability and analysis tools. <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> not only does the tricky work of database schema versioning and management, it also helps you understand the data around these operations and how they fit into your overall DevOps and CI/CD performance.

        <h3>Custom Log Data </h3>
        <p>You can also introduce your own custom and private data into <MadCap:variable name="General.StructuredLog" />s. This allows you to collect, inspect, and analyze the information to better understand and improve your SDLC. To learn how to setup a customlogdata.yaml file, see <MadCap:xref href="meta-data-structured-logs.htm">Custom and Private Data in [%=General.StructuredLog%]s</MadCap:xref>. Learn how to include or exclude your custom data in the default custom-log-data-file here: <MadCap:xref href="../../parameters/custom-log-data-file.htm">custom-log-data-file</MadCap:xref>.</p>
