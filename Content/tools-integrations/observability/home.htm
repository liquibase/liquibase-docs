            <MadCap:xref href="structured-logging.htm">Structured Logging</MadCap:xref> makes <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> operation data easily available for monitoring and analysis tools to read, query, and act upon in automated workflows. This feature improves the way <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> logs its actions and events to make records machine-readable, easily-ingested, and queryable by industry-standard observability and analysis tools. <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> not only does the tricky work of database schema versioning and management, it also helps you understand the data around these operations and how they fit into your overall DevOps and CI/CD performance.
