        <h1>Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Database Limitations</h1>
        <p>"Commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS)&#160;software refers to pre-packaged software products that do not require extensive customization or development. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />&#160;<b>recommends against</b> using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> tools to manipulate or manage the databases of pre-packaged COTS software, unless the vendor of that software explicitly supports <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" />.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;"><b>This does not apply to custom schemas, integrations, or analytics databases external to the COTS application</b>. It only applies to the database schema(s) managed by the COTS vendor's tooling.</p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to make deployments on a database schema managed by your COTS software can interfere with the vendor's upgrade procedures. As a result, your implementation of the COTS&#160;product may be unsupported by the vendor. This can have operational impacts on your business, as you may not be able to easily upgrade to newer versions or easily resolve problems with your COTS system.</p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <h3>Determine impact</h3>
        <p>You are impacted by COTS&#160;limitations if your database meets the following criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You use a <b>pre-packaged</b> COTS software product with a <b>built-in</b> database</li>
            <li>You use the <b>main&#160;database schema</b> built into the COTS database</li>
            <li>Your vendor <b>does not</b> explicitly include <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> as part of their update process</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you meet all these criteria, you should not use <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to manage changes to that database schema. Instead, you should only use vendor-provided tools for that schema.</p>
        <h3>When you can use <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /></h3>
        <p>You can use <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> to manage changes to any database you manage yourself, external from your COTS software. In this case, <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> has no effect on your vendor's COTS software upgrade procedures.</p>
        <p>For example, if you use a <b>custom</b> schema, integration, or analytics database separate from your COTS&#160;software's built-in database schema, you can use <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> on that custom application.</p>
