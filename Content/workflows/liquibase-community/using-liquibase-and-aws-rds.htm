        <h1>Using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> and AWS RDS </h1>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) provides a set of cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications.</p>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a> (Amazon RDS) is a web service that helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. Amazon RDS is available on several <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/">database instance types</a> and offers six database engines including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/">MariaDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/">Oracle Database</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/">SQL Server</a>.</p>
        <p>Each Amazon RDS DB instance has an endpoint, and each endpoint has the DNS name (host) and port number for the DB instance to connect.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> integrates with application build and deploy tools for CI/CD on AWS and automates the deployment of database changes in-line with related application changes. Using <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> and AWS RDS, you can access database engines like PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or Oracle in cloud and control your deployments by versioning them with the SQL, XML, JSON, or YAML files. It means that the code, applications, and tools you use with your existing databases can be used with <MadCap:variable name="General.Liquibase" /> and Amazon RDS to track, manage, and apply database schema changes.</p>
